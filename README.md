Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a discipline focused on the systematic development of high-quality software products using engineering principles, methods, and tools.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages e.g Fortran and C
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
4. Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: incluses ollecting and documenting the needs of users and the system's specifications.
2. Design: Developing both high-level and detailed plans for the software's architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: Coding and constructing the software based on the design guidelines.
4. Testing: Performing tests to verify that the software complies with quality standards and fulfills functional expectations.
5. Deployment: Distributing the software to users or clients.
6. Maintenance: Offering continuous support, updates, and improvements after the software is released.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach where the project is divided into distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation). Each phase must be completed before the next begins, with little room for revisiting previous phases. This methodology can be used when developing a project with well defined requirements and minimum anticipated changes e.g a traditional finance system. On the other hand, agile is an iterative and incremental approach that breaks down the project into smaller sprints or iterations. Each sprint delivers a working product or feature and can incorporate changes based on feedback. It can be appropriate in mobile app development where user needs may evolve over time.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g. Visual Studio.
Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g. Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies to overcome these challenges include: effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Involves testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Is testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Entails testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance of testing: Ensures software quality, reliability, sustainability, resuces development costs and improves user experience.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It is important because it makes questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need and gives an appropriate response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about how the Earth was made.
Improved prompt: Explain the scientific theories about the formation of Earth
Explanation: The improved prompt is clearer as it specifies that the question is about scientific theories rather than a general overview.
